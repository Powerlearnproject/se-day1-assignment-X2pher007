#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software systems that are reliable, efficient, and easy to use.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The NATO Software Engineering Conference (1968)
2. The Development of the Waterfall Model (1970s)
3. The Introduction of Agile Methodologies (2001)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: Define project goals, scope, and timeline. Identify stakeholders, resources, and potential risks.

2. Requirements Gathering: Collect and document what the software needs to do. Talk to stakeholders, users, and experts to understand their needs.

3. Design: Create a blueprint of the software. Decide on the architecture, user interface, and system components.

4. Implementation (or Coding): Write the software code based on the design. Use programming languages and tools to bring the design to life.

5. Testing: Check if the software works as expected. Find and fix bugs, errors, and performance issues.

6. Deployment: Release the software to the public or users. Make it available for download, installation, or access.

7. Maintenance: Keep the software up-to-date, fix issues, and add new features. Ensure it continues to meet user needs and remains secure.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about cats"
"Tell me about the history of domestic cats"
